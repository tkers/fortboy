# FortBoy

_FortBoy_ is a text adventure game written during [7DRL 2022](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2022). It features procedurally generated stories, and runs on the original Game Boy. Perfect for the dungeon crawler on-the-go!

Running this rom from an emulator (or flashing it to a physical cartridge) is highly recommended. The preview that's included on this page does not support sound and lacks the atmosphere a real device brings :)
